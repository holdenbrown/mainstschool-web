I have many wonderful memories of my time at this school, and I love that I get to teach here every day. When I am not teaching, I love spending time with my family and friends. I also love being a dog mom to my beloved dog, Cheese.",

I have taught in a variety of schools, in a range of levels, in many different classrooms. I started my teaching career in the 1970s in Peace Corps/Zaire (Democratic Rep. of the Congo now) and went on to teach in Seattle, WA; Houston, TX: Knoxville and Indianola, IA as well as in private international schools in Turkey and Kuwait. Suffice it to say, I like to change climates from time to time. I love new experiences and learning about new places, cultures and people. That's one of the things that brought me to Main Street. I have loved the freedom to teach a curriculum that speaks to the interests of our kids while holding them to high standards. Teaching is said to be a career, but for me it has been my passion. When I am not teaching, you will find me enjoying my other passion: reading history and political science books on my porch with a glass of iced tea or coffee.",

      "description": "Hi, my name is Chuck Krueger. My teaching career started in the Amana Colonies as a science teacher as a recent graduate of ISU with a BS degree. I had a double major in physics and psychology, and certification in most high school sciences and math. I continued my education at UI in two different programs, the first was solar engineering and the second was science education which were not career options for me but enhanced my knowledge of science and math. We moved to Kansas and I worked as a TAG (Talented and Gifted) teacher for several years. I got my M Ed. from Wichita State University.Eventually we moved to Bettendorf, Iowa where I worked in TAG and taught at Marycrest College. A move to Newton gave me the opportunity to teach for several years at Marshalltown Community College. Today, I enjoy retirement and the opportunity to continue working with students. It is a great joy to see the light bulb go on when a student gets it.",
