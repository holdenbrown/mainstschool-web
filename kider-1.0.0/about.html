                        <p class="mb-3 fs-5">Building a community of learners through personalized education</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">Main Street School officially started in August of 2006 as ASK Learning Center by Tanya Apana. Our intention was to provide an alternative learning environment for students and families who were looking for a smaller, more personalized atmosphere that provided an experiential or project-based curriculum.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">Our students come from various learning environments. For some, this is their first taste of school, and our home-like atmosphere is a welcoming introduction. Some come to us from a homeschooling background, and our flexibility and multi-age classrooms allow for an easy transition.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">Still others transition to Main Street from other private or public schools. Our students come not only from Norwalk, but also many other metro communities. We have had students from Waukee, Urbandale, West Des Moines, Des Moines, Indianola, Martensdale and as far south as St. Mary's and as far north as Ames.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">Children are taught using individual curriculums based on the needs of the whole child. We subscribe to the premise that a quality education focuses on emotional, physical, social and academic development. We work to create a safe and welcoming environment by creating strong relationships amongst teachers, students and families.</p>

It is located at 925 Main Street in a historic home nestled in a neighborhood that provides community interaction. As a non-profit, there is no ownership. There is a director (Head of School) who is overseen by a Board of Directors. We offer an innovative, full-time education for students from age 3 through 12th grade. Beginning with the 2023-24 school year, we partnered with Jordahl Academy to start offering an on-line program available to students grades 5-12th across the state of Iowa. Main Street believes in educating the whole child and works to connect students' learning to the community through integrated projects.</p>
